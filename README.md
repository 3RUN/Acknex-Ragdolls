# Acknex ragdolls

Simple human ragdoll that includes
- (more or less) proper animation blending
- 15 physical body parts
- 6D joints for head and upper arms
- Revolute (hinge) joints for the rest
- Slow motion effect (can be activated with SPACE key)

You can see ragdolls in motion on my youtube channel:

This template uses native acknex physX plugin (A8 version 8.47.1) with a slightly edited ackphysX header.
